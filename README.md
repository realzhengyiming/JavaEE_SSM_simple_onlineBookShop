## Here is a simple ssm project made by me and my friends(mfq and the zhizhen) for finishing the work of "javaEE".
even we have three people to make it,but this project havn't used the git to combine three parts of the project.
So we wasted too much time in combining our project .That's why  I learn the git and the github to avoid the same sitution.

## about this project :
1.the front layout ,we used simple example of Boostrap to make it (version v3.3.7)
2.the admin layout we used H-ui (the other front layout) to make it.
3.the back of the web .we use ssm(spring+springMvc+mybatis ) to make it.


## How to use this project :
### first your need to install the environment of javaEE(Tomcat ,java ,Spring)
### download the project and post it into your tomcat.
### import the bookshop.sql into your mysql(we used mysql )
#### And see the mysql table of user or admin ï¼Œï¼ˆfor some reason we have split the table of user and admin to login in the front or the adminSite.
#### and the first use ï¼Œyou have to login the adminSite and upload the bookMessage and the picture of book,and then you can see the front Home,your upload book is show.
just that ,simple project !ðŸ˜€
